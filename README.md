# GB-Studio-Community-Assets
For all users to submit their own works! Must be original and usable in GB Studio.

You must be okay with all of your submitted work being under the MIT Licence.

In the future this repo could be accessed through a much more user-friendly website. For now, here's a framework to organise our community assets.

# Contribution Guidelines

Create a Github account, make a fork of this repository, add your own stuff and make a pull request. Make sure the page is showing `[my repository] << [your fork]` and I will credit your name in a credits document so we can keep track of who's done what in a more elegant manner than Git's default.

Please let me know if you'd like to be a collaborator on this repo so I'm not the only one approving all the pull requests. ;;

## Background Guidelines

Docs: https://www.gbstudio.dev/docs/backgrounds/

Minimum file dimensions are 160px x 144px

Maximum file dimensions are 256px x 256px

"An image can contain no more than 192 unique 8px x 8px tiles at once due to memory limits."

Use [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) or other programs to help you allign these backgrounds.

Please only put tilesets in the graphics/tilesets folder and finished backgrounds in the /backgrounds folder.

## Sprite Guidelines

Docs: https://www.gbstudio.dev/docs/sprites/

Please keep static sprites in the `/sprites/static/` folder and all not-animated actors in the `/sprites/actors` folder. Animated actors belong only in `/sprites/anim-actors/` and all other animated sprites belong only in `/sprites/anim/`

## UI Guidelines

Docs: https://www.gbstudio.dev/docs/ui-elements/

Please put ascii files in the `/fonts` folder and everything else in the `/UI` folder.

## Music Guidelines

Docs: https://www.gbstudio.dev/docs/music/

Join the GB Studio discord to answer your music questions: https://discord.gg/2hYeJ4m

How music files are grouped here are by no means strict rules, but I would like to use the following genres for songs:

- Action
- Cutscenes
- Jingles
- Menu Themes
- Overworld
- SFX
- Utility (templates for time signatures, other)

## Things yet to be done:

**Music:**

- An example jingle
- Example templates for songs in 4/4, 6/8, etc.
- Example rangetest utility .mod
- Example of .midi converted to .mod
