# GB-Studio-Community-Assets
For all users to submit their own works! Must be original and usable in GB Studio.

In the future this repo could be accessed through a much more user-friendly website. (I would be honoured if someone actually took that initiative, web design is not in my skillset - Ember) For now, here's a framework to organise our community assets.

# Contribution Guidelines and General Help

Create a Github account, make a fork of this repository, add your own stuff and make a pull request. I will credit your name in a credits document so we can keep track of who's created what. Please let me know if you'd like to be a collaborator on this repo so I'm not the only one approving all the pull requests. ;;

You must be okay with all of your submitted work being under the MIT license, and I'll probably change this to a more suitable creative commons license soon.

## Backgrounds

Docs: https://www.gbstudio.dev/docs/backgrounds/

Minimum file dimensions are 160px x 144px

Maximum file dimensions are 256px x 256px

"An image can contain no more than 192 unique 8px x 8px tiles at once due to memory limits."

Use [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) or other programs to help you allign these backgrounds.

Please only put tilesets in the graphics/tilesets folder and finished backgrounds in the /backgrounds folder.

## Sprites

Docs: https://www.gbstudio.dev/docs/sprites/

Please keep static sprites in the `/sprites/static/` folder and all not-animated actors in the `/sprites/actors` folder. Animated actors belong only in `/sprites/anim-actors/` and all other animated sprites belong only in `/sprites/anim/`

## UI

Docs: https://www.gbstudio.dev/docs/ui-elements/

Please put ascii files in the `/fonts` folder and everything else in the `/UI` folder.

## Music

Docs: https://www.gbstudio.dev/docs/music/

Join the GB Studio discord to answer your music questions: https://discord.gg/2hYeJ4m

How music files are grouped here are by no means strict rules, but I would like to use the following genres for songs:

- Action
- Cutscene
- Logo Theme
- Menu Theme
- Overworld
- SFX
- Utility

A list will be created to host the names of song composers once pull requests start getting submitted.

## Things yet to be done:

Create a step by step "How to make a pull request" tutorial in this document - *Good first issue*

Create SFX framework with an example SFX  - *Good first issue*

**Other stuff**

Create Music genre framework with example music
